# Digitizing Medieval Manuscripts in the Midwest

This project works to digitize and create item-level metadata for pre-1600 manuscripts held at institutions of all types across the American Midwest. Hosted at Indiana University Bloomington, our efforts have been generously supported by a 2020 Council on Library and Information Resources Hidden Collections grant and a 2025 Humanities Collections and Reference Resources grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Resulting item descriptions and high-resolution, IIIF-compliant images are being made freely available through a [digital consortial repository](https://go.iu.edu/peripheralmss) hosted by Indiana University Libraries.

For more information about the project, including information about out partners, visit: <https://peripheralmss.org/>.

This GitHub repository hosts some project files for which we want to maintain a clear record of file history.
For now, this is mostly limited to our project documentation. 

## Code of Conduct
- [Community Agreement and Code of Conduct](https://github.com/midwest-manuscripts/peripheralmss/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

## Metadata
Our metadata documentation is based on the metadata practices of the [Bibliotheca Philadelphiensis Project](http://bibliophilly.pacscl.org/).
There are three principal files (in development): 

- [Style Guide](https://github.com/midwest-manuscripts/peripheralmss/blob/master/documentation/style-guide.md). General guidelines for style, usage, and terminology
- [Metadata Guide](https://github.com/midwest-manuscripts/peripheralmss/blob/master/documentation/metadata-guide.md). Line-item instructions for entry of collection- and item-level metadata.
- [Metadata Sharing Guide for Partners](https://github.com/midwest-manuscripts/peripheralmss/blob/master/documentation/peripheralmss_metadata-sharing-partners.pdf). Metadata mapping between OCHRE (canonical database), Digital Collections repository and MARC.

## Digitization
We have digitization guidelines and template Memoranda of Understanding and Care Agreements for the project:

- [Digitization Guidelines](https://github.com/midwest-manuscripts/peripheralmss/blob/master/digitization/digitization_guidelines.md)
- [MOU and Care Agreement for Digitization led by Indiana University Libraries](https://github.com/midwest-manuscripts/peripheralmss/blob/master/digitization/iub_libraries_mou_midwest_medieval_mss_template_iu_digitizes.pdf)
- [MOU for Digitiztion led by Partners](https://github.com/midwest-manuscripts/peripheralmss/blob/master/digitization/iub_libraries_mou_midwest_medieval_mss_template_partner_digitizes.pdf)
