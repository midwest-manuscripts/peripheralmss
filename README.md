# Digitizing Medieval Manuscripts in the Midwest

The Peripheral Manuscripts Project maintains a public-facing website over at <https://peripheralmss.org/>.
Navigate to that site for a description of our project, contact information, project news, and other information.

[The Peripheral Manuscripts Project Digital Collection](https://digitalcollections.iu.edu/collections/5d86qm86k?locale=en) is currently in-progress. Collections will be added over the next few months. 

This GitHub repository hosts some project files for which we want to maintain a clear record of file history.
For now, this is mostly limited to our project documentation. 

## Metadata
Our metadata documentation is based on the metadata practices of the [Bibliotheca Philadelphiensis Project](http://bibliophilly.pacscl.org/).
There are three principal files (in development): 

- [Style Guide](https://github.com/midwest-manuscripts/peripheralmss/blob/master/documentation/style-guide.md). General guidelines for style, usage, and terminology
- [Metadata Guide](https://github.com/midwest-manuscripts/peripheralmss/blob/master/documentation/metadata-guide.md). Line-item instructions for entry of collection- and item-level metadata.

## Digitization
We have digitization guidelines and template Memoranda of Understanding and Care Agreements for the project:

- [Digitization Guidelines](https://github.com/mdalmau/peripheralmss/blob/master/digitization/digitization_guidelines.md)
- [MOU and Care Agreement for Digitization led by Indiana University Libraries](https://github.com/midwest-manuscripts/peripheralmss/blob/master/digitization/iub_libraries_mou_midwest_medieval_mss_template_iu_digitizes.pdf)
- [MOU for Digitiztion led by Partners](https://github.com/midwest-manuscripts/peripheralmss/blob/master/digitization/iub_libraries_mou_midwest_medieval_mss_template_partner_digitizes.pdf)

The directory [`archive`](https://github.com/midwest-manuscripts/peripheralmss/tree/master/archive) contains our CLIR grant application (the main application document and relevant appendices).

This repository also contains our [Community Agreement and Code of Conduct](https://github.com/midwest-manuscripts/peripheralmss/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
