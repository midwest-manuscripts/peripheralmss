# Digitizing Medieval Manuscripts in the Midwest

The Peripheral Manuscripts Project maintains a public-facing website over at <https://peripheralmss.org/>.
Navigate to that site for a description of our project, contact information, project news, and other information.

We use this GitHub repository to host some project files for which we want to maintain a clear record of file history.
For now, this is mostly limited to our [project documentation](https://github.com/sarahloleet/peripheralmss/tree/master/documentation) (in development), based on the metadata practices of the [Bibliotheca Philadelphiensis Project](http://bibliophilly.pacscl.org/).
Our [Community Agreement and Code of Conduct](https://github.com/sarahloleet/peripheralmss/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) is also posted to this site.
