# CATALOGUING GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS

The purpose of the following guidelines is to insure consistency of
style, terminology, format, and data type in cataloguing data and
descriptions. Consistency here means regularity, predictability,
uniformity, and “searchability.” Users of this digitized catalogue
should expect to find the same amount and type of data in each entry
field, and in the same general order.

Consistency in all fields is particularly important for manuscripts of
the same title: Bible, Gospels, Missal, Lectionary, Book of Hours, etc.

For details on what information should be included in specific fields
please refer to the [Spreadsheet Metadata
Guidelines](https://github.com/midwest-manuscripts/peripheralmss/blob/master/documentation/metadata-guide.md)

# GENERAL GUIDELINES

## Sentences and Fragments

The **Description** field is the only entry field to be composed in full
sentences (use present tense verbs). All other fields should be in
phrases or fragments, except where the meaning becomes confusing and
difficult to express without a full sentence.

## Capitalization, Spacing, Punctuation

Capitalize the initial letter of all entries in all fields. Avoid using
unnecessary abbreviations; do not abbreviate the word “Saint.” Single
space (not double) between sentences.

Punctuation follows American usage and goes inside quotation marks: “…
Gothic.” Period at end of full sentences only, not phrases or fragments
(as here)

Avoid unnecessary use of colons in entries.

Semi-colon to separate elements of a fragment

Serial (Oxford) comma: red, white, and blue

If one element in a series of three or more itself consists of a series
of three or more, use a semi-colon, rather than a comma, between
elements of a greater series: 13 stripes; 52 stars; and a color scheme
of red, white, and blue

## Titles

Use lower case for all but first word in a title: *A tainted mantle*
(not *A Tainted Mantle*)

An exception to this rule is that book types, e.g., Psalter, Lectionary,
Book of Hours, Book of Hours Use of Rome, Missal etc. should always be
capitalized in titles. This also applies to terms like Chronicle if it
is used in the sense of it being that type of book, and not just a word
in the title, e.g., Grandes Chroniques

If a slash or colon is part of a title, leave a space on either side: *A
tainted mantle : Hercules and the classical tradition at the Carolingian
court*

## Numbers and Dates

Numbers should be spelled out from one to one hundred in running text
(like the description and longer descriptive passages). After one
hundred, use numerals. Also spell out round numbers: two thousand, but
2,341. Exceptions include numbers in chapters, volumes, verses: chapter
6, volume 2, verse 7

Avoid beginning an entry with a number, but if a number is necessary,
spell it out: Thirty-seven full-page illuminations and 103 historiated
initials

Spell out ordinal numbers: first, not 1<sup>st</sup> ; this also applies
to centuries within text fields: the fourteenth century; a
fourteenth-century manuscript

An exception: in the date narrative field **only**, use the following
format for a century date: 9<sup>th</sup> century

Hyphenate a century only if it is an adjective: a tenth-century
palimpsest (Otherwise: a palimpsest from the tenth century)

Use a hyphen, not a dash, to separate dates in a date range:
9<sup>th</sup>-11<sup>th</sup> century CE

For a birth or death date (e.g., of an author, scribe, patron etc.),
leave a space between the abbreviation and the year: d. 968

For an approximate date, do not abbreviate circa: circa 1400. Circa date
should be only in the Date (narrative) field. Circa date (without
“circa”) should also be in the Date (single) field.

## Citations and Abbreviations

Biblical citations: Exodus 10:12-15 (names of chapters should not be
abbreviated, so spell out “Genesis,” not “Gen.”)

Preferred abbreviation for folio: fol. (plural: fols.)

There is a space between a folio abbreviation and a folio number:
fol. 5r

Always include ‘r’ or ‘v’ with folio number, e.g., fols. 1r-3v, not
1-3v. When indicating a range over the recto/verso of a single folio:
fol. 1r-v

Preferred abbreviation for manuscript/manuscripts: Ms./Mss.

## TERMS AND TERMINOLOGY

These are particularly for **Description,** and **Decoration** fields:
Recommended terms in **bold**

A bound book: **manuscript**

  - acceptable alternatives: codex (although a specialized term),
    volume, book (although this could lead to confusion with a printed
    text), copy (when referring to multiple manuscripts of same text)
  - *not* recommended: work, the present work

A book’s transcription: **copied**

  - acceptable alternatives: written, transcribed
  - *not* recommended: executed, calligraphed, penned

The text or writing on a book page: **written area**

  - acceptable alternatives: justification
  - *not* recommended: text block

Book page/pages: **folio/s** (when foliated) or **page/s** (when
paginated)

  - acceptable alternative (for folio only): leaf/ves

The first (front) side of a book page: **recto**

The second (back or obverse) side of a book page: **verso**

A book’s final (scribal) note: **colophon**

A book’s decoration in general: **decoration, decorated**

  - acceptable alternatives: illumination, illuminated
  - *not* recommended: ornamentation, gilded

A book’s text painting/s in general: **illustration, illustrated,
miniature**

  - acceptable alternatives: painting, painted

A book’s opening, full-page decoration without text: **illuminated** (or
**illustrated) frontispiece**

A book’s opening, full-page decoration including initial text:
**illuminated incipit**

The space/s outside the written area: **margin/s**

  - *not* recommended: border

An unnamed or unknown scribe: **anonymous**

Subjective adjectives and qualitative judgments (famous, well-known,
great, elegant, clear) should be used sparingly throughout.

# ITEM-LEVEL FIELDS

Fields are listed in order of appearance in sheet 1 of the template
spreadsheet. For further details see the [Spreadsheet Metadata
Guidelines](https://github.com/midwest-manuscripts/peripheralmss/blob/master/documentation/metadata-guide.md)

## Repository Country:

Always “United States”

## Repository City:

Name of the city *only*, do not include the name of the state

## Holding Institution:

Name of the institution above the **Repository**. The **Repository**
will be the name of the library, so the **Holding Institution** will
usually be the name of a university. Full name, do not use
abbreviations.

## Repository Name:

Full name, do not use abbreviations.

## Call Number/ID:

Will vary from institution to institution. Use what is provided by the
institution.

## Manuscript Name:

Use names provided by institution. When supplying a name, do so in
English.

## Authors:

Preference is to put the **Authority name:** Common name – this links up
with **Author URI**, usually VIAF number, with the idea that here you
will use the standardized version of the name as designated by the LoC
on their website: <http://authorities.loc.gov/>

If there is not an Authority Name, **Name as written or supplied in
Latin alphabet:** Give the name of the author in Latin letters in
authority form (Last Name, First Name)

## Translators, Artists, Former Owners:

Same rules as **Author** fields above

## Provenance:

In this field the whole known history of the manuscript should be given.
Provenance is concerned with the individuals or institutions that may
have owned or handled a book up to and including the present time, and
should be written out chronologically. Record **Former Owner Names**
separately, in authorized form.

## Date (narrative):

Enter the phrase as given in this row and supply start and end dates in
the appropriate rows, as in the following examples:

| **Date (narrative)**            | **Supply Date (range) start** | **Supply Date (range) end** |
| :------------------------------ | :---------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| 14th century                    | 1300                          | 1399                        |
| Early 14th century              | 1300                          | 1315                        |
| First quarter 14th century      | 1300                          | 1325                        |
| Fourth quarter 14th century     | 1375                          | 1399                        |
| Mid-14th century                | 1340                          | 1360                        |
| 14th century after 1320         | 1320                          | 1399                        |
| Late 14th century               | 1385                          | 1399                        |
| Late 14th or early 15th century | 1385                          | 1415                        |
| Mid-14th to early 15th century  | 1340                          | 1415                        |
| 14th or 15th century            | 1300                          | 1499                        |

## Place of Origin:

This should be a modern geographical location whenever possible
(Flanders being a rare exception). The smallest component of the
location should be listed first, followed by larger locations, usually
simply City, Country, e.g., “Oxford, England,” but this could be more
specific, such as “Monastery of Reichenau, Lake Constance, Germany,” or
could include a region either after a city or as a more specific element
before a country. If country is not known, then a region with an
accepted or commonly used geographical designation may be given.
Cardinal specifications (for example, Northern France) may be included.
Conjectural locations may be followed by a question mark, but only one
question mark should be used in an origin series, at the most specific
level:

  - Paris, France
  - Oxford?, England
  - Florence?, Tuscany, Italy
  - Tuscany?, Italy
  - Northwestern France

The final element of an origin preferably will be an entry from the
European geographic keywords:

  - Austria
  - England
  - Flanders
  - France
  - Germany
  - Greece
  - Italy
  - Netherlands
  - Romania
  - Russia
  - Spain

Multiple locations may be entered in multiple columns for codices
containing multiple manuscripts with different origins bound together.

If a manuscript’s location of origin cannot be determined within Europe
(as is the case for some Greek manuscripts, for example), enter
Undetermined.

## Description:

Each **Description** should, in a **maximum of 250 words,** introduce or
summarize the salient features of a book’s textual, material and
artistic contents, emphasizing the most important qualities that the
reader will need to know about the manuscript – what makes it special or
important? Qualitative judgments and subjective adjectives should be
used sparingly. Important information to include, when known, are the
date of the manuscript, its origin, if it is illuminated, if it is
complete or fragmentary, and the names of authors, scribes, and artists
where applicable.

## Language:

Name of the language or languages represented in the manuscript. Include
names only, one name per column. If there are notes about the use of
languages (e.g., “Latin with Greek glosses”) include all the language
names in the **Language** field, and add the additional information as a
**Note**. Use the following Language codes (from the ISO 639-2) - full
names are provided for reference, do not include them in the field:

  - lat \[Latin\]
  - grc \[Greek\]
  - xno \[Anglo-Norman\]
  - arm \[Armenian\]
  - chu \[Church Slavonic\]
  - dum \[Dutch\]
  - eng \[English after approx 1500\]
  - enm \[English, Middle, to approx 1500\]
  - frm \[French, Middle, approx. 1400-1600\]
  - fro \[French, Old, before approx. 1400\]
  - ger \[German, after approx. 1500\]
  - gmh \[German, Middle High, approx. 1050-1500\]
  - goh \[German, Old High, approx. 750-1050\]
  - heb \[Hebrew\]
  - nds \[Low German\]
  - ita \[Italian\]
  - cat \[Catalan\]
  - spa \[Spanish\]

A fuller list of language codes is posted
[here](https://github.com/midwest-manuscripts/peripheralmss/blob/master/documentation/language-codes.csv).

## Foliation/Pagination:

How the leaves or pages of the manuscript are numbered (in foliation,
each leaf is numbered once; in pagination, both the recto and verso side
of each leaf are numbered), and where the numbers appear on the leaves,
such as *upper right recto* or *lower outer corners*, or *Modern
foliation in pencil, upper right recto*

## Flyleaves & Leaves:

Formula showing the numbers of flyleaves and leaves, in the format
\[front flyleaves\]+\[leaves\]+\[back flyleaves\], for example
ii+113+iii. No spaces. Make note of the flyleaf material using the
**Note** field.

## Layout:

The easiest layout details to capture are number of columns and number
of lines per page, if those are generally consistent throughout the
manuscript or in sections of the manuscript. Information about how a
page is ruled and by what means (drypoint, lead, ink) also goes here.

A written area that is delineated by four intersecting lines that run
from edge to edge is **frame-ruled**

A written area that is delineated by a floating box is **box-ruled**

## Colophon:

Transcription of the colophon, if present. Any other information about a
colophon should be a **Note**.

## Collation:

We will express collation by formula.

<!-- 
Bibliophilly Documentation adds:
<https://biblio-philly-collations.herokuapp.com/>

Proofreaders: If there is anything other than “Structure Uncertain” or a
collation formula/description in this field, please contact Dot.

  - **Draw a diagram and give it to Dot**: diagram submitted
  - **Make a model in the Collation Modeler**: model created
  - **Collation formula generation from model**: \[paste formula here\]
-->

If the collation cannot be determined, enter ‘Structure Uncertain.’

If you can determine part of the collation, but not the entire thing,
you can also describe the collation as best you can and this will be
passed to the TEI

## Script:

Information about the type of lettering used in the manuscript,
preferring the terms listed below if applicable.

  - Square Capitals
  - Rustic Capitals
  - Uncial
  - Half-Uncial
  - Caroline Minuscule
  - Protogothic
  - Gothic–textualis quadrata (consistent application of feet and biting
    of curves)
  - Gothic–textualis semi-quadrata (inconsistent application of feet and
    biting of curves)
  - Gothic–textualis (everything below semi-quadrata; for Gothic with
    single-compartment *a*, sometimes called semitextualis, add a note:
    “Gothic–textualis; single-compartment *a*”)
  - Gothic–rotunda (round Italian textualis, not Brownian rotunda, which
    is English with rounded-off minims)
  - Gothic–anglicana
  - Gothic–cursiva
  - Littera bononiensis
  - Secretary
  - Bâtarde
  - Mercantesca
  - Hybrida
  - Humanistic
  - Humanistic Cursive
  - Humanistic semi-cursive
  - Greek Minuscule

If the scribe is identifiable, include the scribe’s name, preceded by
“Scribe:” For example, “Scribe: Thomas Hoccleve”.

## Musical notation:

If notation is present, describe it here.
<!-- This field is our addition, not yet in the Google Sheet template -->

## Catchwords:

If catchwords are present, where are they found, and what is the
orientation on the page (at the bottom, along the side margin, etc.),
e.g.: On versos, bottom right corner. If they are not consistent (for
instance, where the pages are cropped and some are missing), indicate
that as well.

## Signatures:

If they are using a system in which quires are marked progressively,
rather than using catchwords, you can explain that here. Same rules
apply as for catchwords.

## Note(s):

Additional information about the manuscript that does not fit into other
fields can be added as a note. Acknowledgements of e.g., cataloging work
should not be included in Notes. Unrelated notes should be separated out
into individual cells.

## Related resource:

See the Spreadsheet style guide.

## Keywords

Keywords are listed
[here](https://github.com/midwest-manuscripts/peripheralmss/blob/master/documentation/keywords.csv).
There are seven groups: Book Type, Century, Culture, Descriptive term,
Geography, Subject, and Other.

Add one keyword per column. You should be able to add at least one from
Book Type, Century, Culture, and Geography. Add Descriptive Terms,
Subjects, and Others as relevant. Copy and paste terms to avoid
misspellings.

Keywords are to help users find the books. So consider what terms a user
might select to try to find this book or a book like it, in addition to
considering which terms apply to this book.

If you want to add a new term email the group (Liz, Michelle, Sarah, and
Ian) to explain the need and we’ll deliberate.

# PAGE-LEVEL FIELDS

## TOC:

In Latin transcribed and/or supplied title in square brackets.

## INC and EXP:

Include only for works where they are especially helpful or meaningful.
Do not provide these for Books of Hours, Bibles, or other standard
texts.

On the spreadsheet, INC and EXP for a text belong in the same row as the
TOC for the text. The folio number of the location of the incipit and
explicit go inside the field, after the text, in square brackets, and
following the formatting for folio numbering described earlier in this
document:

| **DISPLAY PAGE** | **FILE\_NAME** | **TAG1** | **VALUE1** | **TAG2** | **VALUE2**               | **TAG3** | **VALUE3**              |
| :--------------- | :------------- | :------- | :--------- | :------- | :----------------------- | :------- | :---------------------- |
| 5v               | 1234-9473.tif  | TOC1     | Title      | INC      | Here begins. \[fol. 5v\] | EXP      | Here ends. \[fol. 31r\] |

In those instances when there is more than one TOC on the same page, the
INC and EXP come after the corresponding TOC. It is fine if some TOCs
lack INC or EXP:

> TOC1 INC TOC2 INC EXP TOC3 EXP \[etc.\]

## DECO:

Brief description of the decoration or illustration. If there is a type
of decoration include the type, followed by a comma, followed by a
description: Diagram, furnace. Anything that can be described well in
the manuscript-level **Decoration** field does not belong in the
page-level **DECO** field, e.g., “Alternating red and blue initials
throughout.”

# Special instructions for Books of Hours

Examples of section descriptions (for descriptions and page-level
metadata):

**TOC elements:**

  - Calendar
  - Calendar, in French
      - i.e. only include the language if it is not Latin
      - in general any vernacular prayers or rubrics should be pointed
        out
  - Gospel Lessons
  - Passion according to John
  - Hours of the Virgin, Use of Rome
  - Hours of the Virgin, Use of Rome, intercalated with the Hours of the
    Cross and Hours of the Holy Spirit
      - We have decided **not** to list the individual hours within the
        office. Even if they begin with miniatures
  - Penitential Psalms, Litany, and Prayers
  - Prayer, Obsecro te
  - Prayer, O intemerata
  - Prayer, Salva sancta facies
  - Prayers, beginning with Salva sancta facies
  - Office of the Dead
  - Suffrages
      - individual suffrages **not** listed as TOC element

**DECO elements:**

  - Inhabited initial Q, a monk
      - inhabited = figures that are decorative only, with no precise
        subject, i.e. a saint
  - Historiated initial D, Annunciation
      - historiated = identifiable figure, i.e. Saint Peter, or a scene,
        i.e. Martyrdom of Saint Paul
  - Small miniature, Annunciation
  - Large miniature, Annunciation
  - Full-page miniature, Annunciation
      - the distinction is that a full-page miniature has no lines of
        text on the page

Sometimes miniatures are divided into subsections, for example a
full-page miniature that depicts four different stages of a character’s
story within the same frame. In this case identify the size of the
miniature, then each section individually separated by semicolons. Each
group of sections (e.g., top row, bottom row) should be preceded by a
directional cue describing which direction the images are to be read.
The following example is from a Hebrew manuscript, so images are to be
read upper to lower, right to left:

  - Full-page miniature, upper right to left, Moses with Jethro’s flock
    (Exodus 3:1); Moses and the Burning Bush (Exodus 3:5); lower right
    to left, Moses answers the Lord, holding up his rod – a shepherd’s
    staff (Exodus 4:2); his rod turns into a serpent (Exodus 4:4); Moses
    holds the serpent (Exodus 4:4)

Names of standard iconographies:

  - Annunciation
  - Visitation
  - Nativity
  - Annunciation to the Shepherds
  - Adoration of the Magi
  - Presentation in the Temple
  - Flight into Egypt
  - Massacre of the Innocents
  - Coronation of the Virgin
  - Agony in the Garden
  - Crucifixion
  - Pentecost
  - Saint John the Baptist
  - Saint Catherine
      - we have decided to include Saint before proper names of saints
